# EarthByte_Underworld
A fork of Underworld 1.8, with all Python and gLucifer bindings removed. For legacy use with the LMR!

## Who should use this
You should only use this version of Underworld if you have been directed to via the LMR (the Lithospheric Modelling Recipe). If you are new to Underworld, I recommend you get Underworld2 from here: https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld2.
