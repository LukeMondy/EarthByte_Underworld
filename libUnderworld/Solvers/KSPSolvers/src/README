This component provides a direct interface between the Underworld solve system and the KSP solvers
of Petsc as well as KSP style solvers in this directory.

Two interfaces are:

StokesBlockKSPInterface:
connects KSP's to Underworld to solve the Stokes system
using PetscExt block matrices.

StokesBlockSNESInterface:
provides a proper interface between Petsc's non-linear solver (SNES)
and the Underworld solve system. This interface also creates a PetscExt block matrix
for the Stokes system.

These two interfaces can be used as examples for new interfaces (that don't necessarily use
PetscExt block matrices)

To add a new KSP style solver, look in the 'Test' directory for an example of the
minimum required to create one.

For a more involved example look in the BSSCR directory.

The only file that requires editing in order to add a new KSP to the system is to include
a header file in ksp-register.c and include a KSPRegister<YOUR_KSP_NAME> in that file
