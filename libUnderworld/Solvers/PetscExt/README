1) Installation: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Installtion of PETScExt is very similar to installing PETSc. In fact it re-uses
  much of the information already obtained from the PETSc configuration. Before
  installing PETScExt you will need to have installed petsc-3.1. PETScExt 
  requries that the environment variable PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH are set.

  Invoke the following commands from the toplevel PETScExt directory [bash] 
  	export PETSCEXT_DIR=`pwd`
  	./config/configure.py
  	make all
  	make check

  Note that if you made static libraries, then the disk space used by all executables 
  generated the the purpose will be large. Thus its recommened after testing is completed
  that you perform
  	make clean_check
  to remove the executables associated with each test.



2) Linking against PETScExt: --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  If you configured your PETSc build with the --shared=1 option, then PETScExt will
  also be build with shared libraries. To link against the PETScExt libraries you
  will be required (under Linux) to modify your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
  to include the location ${PETSCEXT_DIR}/lib/${PETSC_ARCH}. 
  	[bash]
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${PETSCEXT_DIR}/lib/${PETSC_ARCH}
	[tcshrc]
		setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${PETSCEXT_DIR}/lib/${PETSC_ARCH}

  For mac's you also need to modify the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, so peform
  	[bash]
		export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	[tcshrc]
		setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH



3) Additional useful make options: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  make distclean; 
	Removes all output generated by the tests and the test exectuables. It will also
	remove the directories ${PETSCEXT_DIR}/lib/${PETSC_ARCH} and ${PETSCEXT_DIR}/bmake/${PETSC_ARCH}.
	Hence, you will need to reconfigure if you wish to rebuild the PETScExt libraries.

  make install;
	Following a successfull "make", provided you provided configure with an installation directory via
		./config/configure.py --prefix=/install/dir/for/petscext
	, this command will carryout the installation procedure.

  make build_check;
	Compiles all the tests, but does not carrry out the testing process.

  make check;
	Compiles (if required) the test and conducts  the tests.

  make clean_check;
	Removes all output generated by the tests and the test exectuables.
